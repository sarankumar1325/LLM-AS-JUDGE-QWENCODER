## üèÜ **Proven Query Examples**

### **RAG WINS** - Queries requiring specific facts:

#### 1. **Exact Financial Data**
```
"What was Apple's exact revenue in Q4 2019?"
```
**Why RAG Wins:** Provides precise figures ($64.04B) vs approximations (~$64B)
**Expected Scores:** RAG: 9.0, Non-RAG: 6.0

#### 2. **Direct Quotes**
```
"What did Tim Cook say about iPhone pricing in Apple's Q2 2018 earnings call?"
```
**Why RAG Wins:** Delivers verbatim quotes vs general paraphrasing
**Expected Scores:** RAG: 9.5, Non-RAG: 5.0

#### 3. **Specific Comparisons**
```
"Compare AMD's and Intel's exact R&D spending percentages for 2018"
```
**Why RAG Wins:** Exact percentages (21.4% vs 19.2%) vs general trends
**Expected Scores:** RAG: 9.0, Non-RAG: 4.0

### **NON-RAG WINS** - Queries requiring broad knowledge:

#### 1. **Economic Theory**
```
"How do economic cycles typically affect technology company valuations?"
```
**Why Non-RAG Wins:** Comprehensive economic framework vs fragmented examples
**Expected Scores:** RAG: 4.0, Non-RAG: 8.5

#### 2. **Investment Principles**
```
"What are the key principles for evaluating technology companies as long-term investments?"
```
**Why Non-RAG Wins:** Universal framework vs narrow company examples
**Expected Scores:** RAG: 5.0, Non-RAG: 9.0

#### 3. **Current Trends**
```
"What are the latest AI trends affecting tech companies in 2024-2025?"
```
**Why Non-RAG Wins:** Current knowledge vs historical limitations (2016-2019 data)
**Expected Scores:** RAG: 3.0, Non-RAG: 9.0

## ‚öñÔ∏è **LLM-as-Judge Evaluation Process**

### **Evaluation Criteria (1-10 scale):**
- **Accuracy:** Factual correctness and precision
- **Completeness:** How fully the query is answered
- **Relevance:** Direct relevance to the question
- **Clarity:** Clear, understandable presentation
- **Source Reliability:** Trustworthiness of information

### **Judge Model:** Qwen 3-32B via Groq API
- Evaluates both responses side-by-side
- Provides detailed reasoning for decisions
- Returns structured JSON with scores
- Determines overall winner

### **Sample Judge Response:**
```json
{
  "response_a_scores": {"overall": 8.6},
  "response_b_scores": {"overall": 6.8}, 
  "winner": "A",
  "reasoning": "Response A provides specific, verifiable financial data..."
}
```

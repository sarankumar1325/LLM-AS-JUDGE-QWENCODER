In contractions, tech stocks often see higher volatility due to their growth nature, but established companies with strong cash flows tend to be more resilient. Key factors include: interest rate sensitivity (affects discount rates), demand elasticity for tech products, and the counter-cyclical nature of digital transformation initiatives.",
